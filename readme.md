## About Me 
&emsp;&emsp; I am now a lecturer at department of mathematics of [Changshu Institute of Technology](https://www.cslg.edu.cn/). I obtained my PhD in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Mao Sheng.

My name in Chinese: 宋子妍(Simplified)

##  Research Interests 

&emsp;&emsp; I am interested in arithmetic and algebraic geometry. My current projects are related to:

- p-adic non-abelian Hodge theory
- perfectoid geometry
- non-archimedean dynamic systems


## Notes 

- [Introduction to perfectoid space](Notes/SCH.pdf)

> &emsp;My personal notes when learning the videos of Arizona Winter School 2017 by Scholze. This note contains the motivation of the theory of perfectoid spaces. 

## Beamers

- [Rigid analytic $p$-adic Simpson correspondence for line bundles](Beamers/DEF.pdf)  PhD thesis defense, 5/8/2022.

## Research

&emsp;&emsp; All of my preprints can be found on arXiv.
